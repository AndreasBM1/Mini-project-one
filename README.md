# Mini-project-one

To compile and run the Mini-project, open a terminal with its path in the /src folder.
Then write "javac *.java" to compile all the classes.
Finally, run the class containing the main method to start the program:
"java BookingSystem" 

(Be aware that the quotation marks surround the commands and must be omitted in the terminal)
((Important to be aware of which directory you are in, must be in the /src folder!!!))
